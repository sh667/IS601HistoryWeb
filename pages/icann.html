        <h3>ICANN</h3>

        <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is an American multistakeholder group and nonprofit
            organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and
            procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the
            network's stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the
            Central Internet Address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers
            Authority (IANA) function contract.Much of its work has concerned the Internet's global Domain Name System
            (DNS), including policy development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic
            top-level domains (TLDs), and the operation of root name servers. The numbering facilities ICANN manages
            include the Internet Protocol address spaces for IPv4 and IPv6, and assignment of address blocks to regional
            Internet registries. ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers.

            ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational stability of
            the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global Internet community; and
            to develop policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up, consensus-based processes.The Green Paper
            proposed certain actions designed to privatize the management of Internet names and addresses in a manner
            that allows for the development of competition and facilitates global participation in Internet management.

        <h3>History of ICANN</h3>
        <p>The Green Paper proposed certain actions designed to privatize the management of Internet names and addresses
            in a manner that allows for the development of competition and facilitates global participation in Internet
            management.
            The Green Paper proposed for discussion a variety of issues relating to DNS management including private
            sector creation of a new not-for-profit corporation (the "new corporation") managed by a globally and
            functionally representative board of directors. ICANN was formed in response to this policy.ICANN managed
            the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) under contract to the United States
            Department of Commerce (DOC) and pursuant to an agreement with the IETF.
        </p>

        <p>ICANN was incorporated in California on September 30, 1998, with entrepreneur and philanthropist Esther Dyson
            as founding chairwoman.It is a nonprofit public benefit corporation "organized under the California
            Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable and public purposes."ICANN was established in
            California due to the presence of Jon Postel, who was a founder of ICANN and was set to be its first Chief
            Technology Officer prior to his unexpected death. ICANN formerly operated from the same Marina del Rey
            building where Postel formerly worked, which is home to an office of the Information Sciences Institute at
            the University of Southern California.
        </p>
        <p>
            Per its original by-laws,primary responsibility for policy formation in ICANN was to be delegated to
            three supporting organizations (Address Supporting Organization, Domain Name Supporting Organization, and
            Protocol Supporting Organization), each of which was to develop and recommend substantive policies and
            procedures for the management of the identifiers within their respective scope. They were also required to
            be financially independent from ICANN. As expected, the regional Internet registries and the IETF agreed
            to serve as the Address Supporting Organization and Protocol Supporting Organization respectively,
            and ICANN issued a call for interested parties to propose the structure and composition of the Domain Name
            Supporting Organization.
        </p>

        <h3>ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)</h3>
        <p>ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is the private (non-government) non-profit
            corporation with responsibility for IP address space allocation, protocol parameter assignment, domain name
            system management, and root server system management functions, the services previously performed by the
            Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
        </p>
        <p>Initial members of the ICANN board were chosen by the late Dr. Jonathon Postel, who headed IANA. IANA derived
            its authority under a contract from the U.S. government which financed the original research network,
            Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, from which the Internet grew. The need to internationalize the
            governing of the Internet led the U.S. government to recommend the origin of ICANN as
            a global, government-independent entity to manage the systems and protocols that keep the Internet going.
            The U.S. government is essentially turning over control of the Internet to ICANN although domain name
            registration performed by Network Solutions, Inc. will continue to be under U.S. government contract for a
            limited time.
        </p>
        <p>ICANN has a board of nineteen Directors, nine At-Large Directors, nine to be nominated by Supporting
            Organizations, and the President/CEO. The nine At-Large Directors of the Initial Board are
            serving one-year terms and will be succeeded by At-Large Directors elected by an at-large membership
            organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since its beginning, ICANN has had to deal with controversial issues such as what new top-level domain
            names should be permitted and whether alternative root server systems should be allowed.
