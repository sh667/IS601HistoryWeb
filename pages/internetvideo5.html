    <h3>The need for encryption</h3>
    <p>A huge amount of private data is sent around the Internet every day: emails with details about our personal
        lives,
        passwords that we type into login screens, tax documents that we upload to servers.</p>

    <p>The Internet protocols send private data in packets on the same routes as everyone else's data, and
        unfortunately,
        attackers have figured out ways to look at the data whizzing around the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>That's where encryption comes in: encrypting data means that we scramble the original data to hide the meaning of
        the text, while still making it possible for the data to be unscrambled using a secret key.
        Encryption enables two people (or computers!) to share private information over open networks.</p>
    <p>Now we'll dive into the two most common types of encryption used in securing Internet communications: symmetric
        encryption and public key encryption.</p>

    <h3>Encryption, decryption, and cracking</h3>

    <p>One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand
        years ago to communicate messages to his allies.
        The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its
        simplicity.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Encrypting a message</strong></h3>
    <p>Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:</p>
    <p>SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE</p>
    <p>Here's what that might look like encrypted:</p>
    <p>YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK</p>
    <p>That looks an awfully lot like gobbledygook at first, but this encrypted message is actually very related to the
        original text.</p>
    <p>The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in
        the
        alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.</p>

    <h3><strong>Decrypting a message</strong></h3>
    <p> According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the
        shift
        amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.</p>
    <p>Imagine Caesar sends this message to a comrade:</p>
    <p>EHZDUH EUXWXVA</p>
    <p>Answer:</p>
    <strong>BEWARE BRUTUS</strong>

    <p>Caesar Cipher was very easy to crack because English Alphabets were only 26.Later then made the code for each
        alphabet in the message, which made it very hard to decode the message without the key. </p>

    <h3>Public key encryption</h3>

    <p>On the Internet, two computers often want to exchange secure data with each other. When I type my password into
        the login screen, I want my computer to send that data safely to the servers. I do not
        want to worry that an attacker might be monitoring my Internet traffic and watching the password go across the
        wires.
    </p>
    <p> Symmetric encryption techniques rely on both the sender and receiver using the same key to encrypt and decrypt
        the data. How can my computer and the server exchange the key securely? If an attacker can see my
        password go across the wires, then they can also see an encryption key!
    </p>

    <p>Public key encryption to the rescue! It's an asymmetric encryption technique which uses different keys for
        encryption and decryption, allowing computers over the Internet to securely communicate with each other.</p>
    <p>Let's step through the high-level process of public key encryption.</p>
    <ui>
        <li>Step 1: Key generation</li>
        <p>Each person (or their computer) must generate a pair of keys that identifies them: a private key and a public
            key.
            You can generate a pair below, using the same RSA algorithm that's used by your computer.
        </p>
        <p> Did you notice it takes a few seconds to generate the keys? That's due to the math involved. The keys are
            generated by multiplying together two incredibly large primes. The algorithm repeatedly generates random
            large numbers and checks if they're prime, until it finally finds two random large primes. All that checking
            for primes can take a while, and these keys are only 512 bits long. The current nationally recommended key
            length is 2048, or even 3072 bits.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2: Key exchange</li>
        <p>The sending and receiving computers exchange public keys with each other via a reliable channel, like TCP/IP.
            The private keys are never exchanged.
        </p>
        <li>Step 3: Encryption</li>
        <p>The sending computer encrypts the secret data using the receiving computer's public key and a mathematical
            operation.</p>
        The power of public key encryption is in that mathematical operation. It's a "one-way function", which means
        it's incredibly difficult for a computer to reverse the operation and discover the original data. Even the
        public key cannot be used to decrypt the data.
        </p>
        <li>Step 4: Sending encrypted data</li>
        <p>The sender can now safely transmit the encrypted data over the Internet without worry of onlookers.</p>
        <li>Step 5: Decryption</li>
        <p>Now the receiver can decrypt the message, using their private key. That's the only key that can be used to
            decrypt the message (in the world!).</p>
    </ui>
