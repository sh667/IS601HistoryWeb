        <h3>How is information sent over the internet ?</h3>

        <p>Information sent over the internet is more like a postal service. The message is posted by the sender in a
            postbox and its delivered to the receiver.
            In the same way the information is sent over the internet in form of binary data. Binary data is usually in
            forms on 0's and 1's.The information is sent over the internet cables in forms of binary data.
            Before binary data was expressed in switches, sounds and etc. Switch was used in communication,if the sender
            wants to display 1. He would have turned on the switch for the receiver to get the message.In the same way
            if
            the sender wanted to send 5 1's at a time. The receiver recorded the amount of time per second the bulb was
            on
            to find the number of bits.
            This developed the bitrate. Bitrate is defined as the amount of bits transferred to a receiver in one
            second.
            Binary bits is also called binary code because it as only two states.
        </p>

        <p>The formation of data :
            <ui>
                <li>8 bits ----> 1 byte</li>
                <li>1000 bytes ----> 1 Kilo Byte</li>
                <li>1000 kilo byte -----> 1 mega byte</li>
            </ui>
        </p>

        <p>Usually a song will be of 3-4 Mega byte of data.</p>

        <p>Before the bits were sent by these methods:
            <ui>
                <li>Telegraphy</li>
                <li>Braille</li>
                <li>Semaphore</li>
            </ui>
        </p>

        <p>After all that today we can send data over the internet in below methods:
            <ui>
                <li>Electricity</li>
                <li>Ligth</li>
                <li>Radio</li>
            </ui>
        </p>

        <h3>Electricity:</h3>
        <div class="text-center">
            <div>
                <img src="../images/internetv11.jpg" alt="inventionimage"
                     style="horiz-align:center;width:300px;height:250px">

        <p>Binary data was expressed in switches. Switch was used in communication,if the sender wants to display 1. He
            would have turned on the switch for the receiver to get the message.In the same way if the sender wanted to
            send 5 0's at a time. The receiver recorded the amount of time per second the bulb was on to find the number
            of bits.
            This developed the bitrate. Bitrate is defined as the amount of bits transferred to a receiver in one
            second.
            Sending 1 bit per second is not fast , so we had to increase the bandwidth.</p>

        <p>Bandwidth:Bandwidth is defined as amount of the transmission capacity,measured by bitrate.
            Bitrate: Bitrate is the amount of binary data sent over in one second by the system.
            Latency: The time take for a bit to travel from sender to receiver is called latency.</p>

        <p>For an example ,you want to download a 3-4 Mb song in three seconds. So bitrate is 8 Mbps.Humans cannot send
            files in the bitrate.
            So we needed machines , then came the cables where information was transferred.</p>

        <h3>Cables:</h3>
        <div class="text-center">
            <div>
                <img src="../images/internetv12.jpg" alt="inventionimage"
                     style="horiz-align:center;width:300px;height:250px">
            </div>
        </div>
        </br>
        <p>The Ethernet cables present in the house is good for short distances.For long distance ,they came up with a
            new cable called the optic fiber.
            Optic fiber transmits light over the cable. As we all know that speed of light is the highest. Information
            was sent over the fibers in form of binary data in form on light waves.
            Using optic fibers we can send multiple bits of data , by sending light in different angles.</p>

        <p>Next came the thought of how to send the data wireless:
            This could be done by radio singles.</p>

        <h3>Wireless:</h3>
        <div class="text-center">
            <div>
                <img src="../images/internetv13.jpg" alt="inventionimage"
                     style="horiz-align:center;width:300px;height:250px">
            </div>
        </div>
        </br>
        <p>The binary bits are sent over the radio singles.The binary bits is converted into radio waves of different
            frequency.
            The sender converts the data to digital singles and the receiver converts back the digital singles intp
            binary data.</p>

        <p>In the future , data may be sent by drones , balloons and etc . But they all will use the same binary form is
            data.</p>
