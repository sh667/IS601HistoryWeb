        <h3>Tim Berners-Lee</h3>

        <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an
            English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is a Professorial Fellow of
            Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
            (MIT). Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989, then implemented
            the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the
            internet in mid-November.
        </p>

        <p>Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which oversees the continued development
            of the Web.
        </p>

        <h3>Things he did:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>In 1989, CERN was the largest internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join
                hypertext with the internet:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <p>He just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain
                    name system ideas and the World Wide Web. Creating the web was really an act of
                    desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later.
                    Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the internet, multifont text
                    objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of
                    generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems
                    out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.
                </p>

            </ul>
            <p>Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it
                was available to the Internet from the CERN network.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>info.cern.ch</strong> was the address of the world's first-ever website and web server,
                    running on a NeXT computer at CERN. The first webpage address was <a
                            href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a>,
                    which centred on information regarding the WWW project. Visitors could learn more about hypertext,
                    technical details for creating their own webpage, and even an explanation on how to search the Web
                    for information. There are no screenshots of this original page and, in any case, changes were made
                    daily to the information available on the page as the WWW project developed. You may find a later
                    copy (1992) on the World Wide Web Consortium website.
                </p>
