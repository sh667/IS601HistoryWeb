        <h3>World Wide Web Consortium</h3>

        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.
            Founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that
            maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web.
        </p>

        <h3>History of W3C</h3>

        <p>TThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European
            Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October, 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission, the Defense
            Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the
            Internet. It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with CSAIL, to the Stata
            Center.

            The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new
            standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing
            inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a
            set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.

            It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on
            particle physics, not information technology.

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Design Principles</h4></li>
            <p>The following design principles guide W3C's work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Web for All</h4></li>
                <p>The social value of the Web is that it enables human communication, commerce, and opportunities to
                    share
                    knowledge. One of W3C's primary goals is to make these benefits available to all people, whatever
                    their
                    hardware, software, network infrastructure, native language, culture, geographical location, or
                    physical or
                    mental ability. Learn more about:

                <p>The number of different kinds of devices that can access the Web has grown immensely. Mobile phones,
                    smart phones, personal digital assistants, interactive television systems, voice response systems,
                    kiosks and even certain domestic appliances can all access the Web. Learn more about:

            <li><h4>Vision</h4></li>
            <p>W3C's vision for the Web involves participation, sharing knowledge, and thereby building trust on a
                global scale.:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Web for Rich Interaction</h4></li>
                <p>The Web was invented as a communications tool intended to allow anyone, anywhere to share
                    information. For many years, the Web was a "read-only" tool for many. Blogs and wikis brought more
                    authors to the Web, and social networking emerged from the flourishing market for content and
                    personalized Web experiences. W3C standards have supported this evolution thanks to strong
                    architecture and design principles. Learn more about:

                </ul>
                <li><h4>Web of Data and Services</h4></li>
                <p>Some people view the Web as a giant repository of linked data while others as a giant set of services
                    that exchange messages. The two views are complementary, and which to use often depends on the
                    application. Learn more about::

                </ul>
                <li><h4>Web of Trust</h4></li>
                <p>The Web has transformed the way we communicate with each other. In doing so, it has also modified the
                    nature of our social relationships. People now "meet on the Web" and carry out commercial and
                    personal relationships, in some cases without ever meeting in person. W3C recognizes that trust is a
                    social phenomenon, but technology design can foster trust and confidence. As more activity moves
                    on-line, it will become even more important to support complex interactions among parties around the
                    globe. Learn more about:
